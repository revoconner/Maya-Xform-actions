## Actions
1. Center Pivot
2. Send pivot to the lowest point on the object
3. Snap object's lowest point to the grid (place on grid)
4. Send pivot to origin
5. Send object (using center of bounding box) to the pivot
6. Place object on pivot (send the lowest point of the bounding box to pivot)

The script also features a way to close the dialog box on any button press saving user's click. This behaviour can be turned off using the checkbox.
